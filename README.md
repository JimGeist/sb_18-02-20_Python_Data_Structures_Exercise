## Python Data Structures Practice 

What a truly crazy exercise -- 44 python routines to write to practice python syntax and list, set, dictionary, tuple data structures, and list comprehension. The odd thing was that some of the coding challenges were harder than the 'harder further study' problems. 

The hardest further study problem was the read from a file because using a for-loop and treating the file as an iterable was a new concept when you come from a while !EOF world! The python code to read a file made a heck of a lot more sense now than it did in an earlier python course. 


## Assignment Details
**ASSIGNMENT INVOLVED**:
- THIRTY-NINE, 39 coding challenges. Some were trivial, others involved some thought. Most of them incorporated the use of a list, set, dictionary, or tuple.
- 5 'harder' further study problems. They were not hard. The difficult one was is_odd_string because they were kinda lazy on their
docstring description and examples -- really 'A', 'a', sum to one while 'AAaa' and 'aaaa' sum to four?? aBc summing to 6 is clearer!


**TIMING**:
- 12 hours for an assignment that listed 8 hours on the high side to complete. I am feeling like I am missing something or overthinking the solution. The timing on some of these exercises is a concern. The core 39 challenges were completed in around 9 hours -- still beyond the 8 hour high limit, and I have yet to review the solutions too :/
